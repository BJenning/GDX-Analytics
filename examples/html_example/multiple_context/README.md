## GDX Analytics HTML/Javascript Example

This code demonstrates using the HTML/Javascript tracker to push custom events the the Snowplow Tracker. For more information on the Snowplow Javascript Tracker see https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker. NOTE: This is using an old version of the custom event schema. 

## Multiple Context Example
