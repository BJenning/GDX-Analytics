## GDX Analytics HTML/Javascript Example

This code demonstrates using the HTML/Javascript tracker to push custom events the the Snowplow Tracker. For more information on the Snowplow Javascript Tracker see https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker. 

This includes two examples:
* [index.html](index.html) demonstrates how to push non-website events to a custom Snowplow schema (NOTE: This is using an old version of the CFMS custom event schema.)
* [test_html_node_context.html](test_html_node_context.html) demonstrates how to add a custom context to a Snowplow page view event. 

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

## To Run

Open [index.html](index.html) or [test_html_node_context.html](test_html_node_context.html) in your web browser and the events will be sent to Snowplow Mini for viewing.
