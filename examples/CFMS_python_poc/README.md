## GDX Analytics Python Example

This code is a proof of concept of Python code required to add Snowplow instrumentation using the initial CFMS proof of concept model. For more information on the Snowplow Python Tracker see https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-python-tracker.

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

## To install the Snowplow Python library

```
$ sudo pip install snowplow-tracker
```

## To Run

```
$ python sn.py
```

## Special files in this repository
The files in [schemas/ca.bc.gov.cfmspoc](../schemas/ca.bc.gov.cfmspoc) are the Snowplow schema files. See https://github.com/snowplow/iglu for more info.

## If you encounter an SSL certificate error
When connecting to Snowplow signed by a BC Government SSL certificate you may encounter this Python error:
```
WARNING:snowplow_tracker.emitters:[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:833)
```
This occurs on some systems where your Python environment is missing the root certificate used to sign our SSL certificate. It appears that the Certificate Authority (CA) for Entrust is missing. 

You can test this on the main HTTPS certificate using an interactive Python session by running: 
```
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://www2.gov.bc.ca')
```

To work around this issue, download the CA from https://www.entrustdatacard.com/pages/root-certificates-download. 
Look for the "Entrust Root Certificate Authorityâ€”G2" and dowload the certificate from https://entrust.com/root-certificates/entrust_g2_ca.cer. 

To ensure that Python loads this CA, can set this environment variable:
```
# export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/entrust_g2_ca.cer
```
