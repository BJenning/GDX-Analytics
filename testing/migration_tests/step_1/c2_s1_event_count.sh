# File:   c2_s1_event_count.sh
# Usage:  $ ./c2_s1_event_count.sh <path_to_logs>

# This script will count the number of lines in the files under <path_to_logs>
# and subtract the lines containing header information (9 from sed command and
# 4 from SDC server) and fixes the total. SDC server writes each event to its 
# own line. Output will display the adjusted event counts present in each logs.

# Caveats:
# - months contributing 0 log files result in a wc error message
# - months contributing only 1 log file will fail to produce any output
# - these do not cause a failure; the next line is proceessed with no interrupt
